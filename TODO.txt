*** Main Task ***

1. [DONE] Save initial parameters of Paddle at the end of each level into PlayerPrefs through the PrefsManager;

2. [DONE] Add "Continue" button into Menu. On "Continue" button click load level and initial parameters of Paddle from PlayerPrefs through the PrefsManager; On "Start" button click load the first level and initial parameters of Paddle from Config;

3. [DONE] Create Bonus Manager
* VO
	- List<GameObject>;
	- List<CollectibleItem>;
	- float probability;
	- bool useDynamicBalance;
	- float perUnit;
//
The main idea is to tie Collectable items to group (or one) of GameObjects. When GO is destroyed BM launch item at its position. 
About probability:
- it can be constant;
- it can be dynamic balance: %P increases when effect isn't taken;
- it can be dynamic balance: %P increases when effect isn't taken and decreases if effect is taken;

4. [DONE] Add Paddle weapon basic implementation;

5. [INCOMPLETE] Create Enemy shoot manager;

*** Small Fix ***
