*** Main Task ***

1. [INCOMPLETE] Create one event CreatureEvent.creatureWasDestroyed. Create VO for saving data into this event. It should include tag, transform, instanceID, name;

2. [INCOMPLETE] Save initial parameters of Paddle at the end of each level into PlayerPrefs through the PrefsManager;

3. [INCOMPLETE] Create Bonus Manager
* VO
	- List<GameObject>;
	- List<CollectibleItem>;
	- float probability;
	- bool useDynamicBalance;
	- bool customDynamicBalance;
		- float minProbability;
		- float maxProbability;
		- float perUnit;
//
The main idea is to tie Collectable items to group (or one) of GameObjects. When GO is destroyed BM launch item at its position. 
About probability:
- it can be constant;
- it can be dynamic balance: %P increases when effect isn't taken;
- it can be dynamic balance: %P increases when effect isn't taken and decreases if effect is taken;

4. [INCOMPLETE] Add Paddle weapon basic implementation;

5. [INCOMPLETE] Create Enemy shoot manager;

6. [INCOMPLETE] Try to use method Vector2.Reflect to move ball. Add check for 90 degrees;

*** Small Fix ***

1. [INCOMPLETE] Create area effectors (left and down) with very small magnitude to avoid ball stucking between two indestructible objects (when X or Y position doesn't change). Change Ball prefab gravity scale to zero;

2. [INCOMPLETE] SummonPhantom effect - copy parameters from target ball;

3. [DONE] Use PaddleParameters with CreatureParameters;

4. [INCOMPLETE] Add sounds to brick prefabs;

5. [INCOMPLETE] Add Lightning effects;

6. [INCOMPLETE] Add Laser weapon;
