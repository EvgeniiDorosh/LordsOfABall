Paddle:
- Create area effectors (left and down) with very small magnitude to avoid ball stucking between floor and roof (when x position doesn't change);
- Try to avoid all "base.Awake" etc.;
- SummonPhantom - copiyng params & abilities from target ball;
- Bless/Curse - sound to prefab;
- Use PaddleParameters instead of CreatureParameters;
- Bricks - sounds to prefabs;
- Is it good to send gameObject reference with event data? Ask at unity forum;
- Global obgect to save/load to file Paddle parameters;
- Add sound "Ball to Paddle";

- Create Bonus Manager

//
The main idea is to tie Collectable items to group (or one) of GameObjects. When GO is destroyed BM launch item at its position. 
About probability:
- it can be constant;
- it can be dynamic balance: %P increases when effect isn't taken;
- it can be dynamic balance: %P increases when effect isn't taken and decreases if effect is taken;
